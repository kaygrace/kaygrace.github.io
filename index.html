								<b>Education</b><br> I'm currently working on my Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Delaware! My M.S. in Physics was 
								conferred in the Spring of 2025. I previously completed a B.A. in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and a B.S. in Physics 
								at the University of Connecticut.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests</b><br> I'm currently undertaking a project to determine the blue edge of the helium atmosphere white
								dwarf instability strip using <it>Hubble Space Telescope</it> observations. I started my work at UD by continuing a 40+ year investigation
								into helium atmosphere pulsating white dwarfs. Current favorite: GD358.

								<b>Asteroseismology of Pulsating WDBs</b><br>For the first two years of my Ph.D., I have been studying pulsating helium
								atmosphere white dwarf GD 358. This WD has been studied for over 40 years, and for the past two years I have been 
								combining ground-based observations with <it>TESS</it> data to create updated asteroseismic and spectroscopic models of GD 358. I 
								have expanded my research to include other helium atmosphere pulsating WDs as part of my dissertation work. I have also been
								analyzing the spectra of seven helium atmopshere white dwarfs (DBs) to determine the location of the hot edge of the DB instability strip.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>EM Detectability of SMBHs</b><br>For my junior and senior years of undergrad, I worked with Dr. Megan Davis on a project
								concerning the electromagnetic detectability of binary supermassive black holes using the Vera Rubin Observatory. This 
								work determined that the false positive detection rate is more than one in five, and this work culminated in my undergraduate 
								thesis, several poster presentations, and a publication in the Astrophysical Journal.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>IceCube REU </b><br>I worked for 10 weeks at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls on a project simulating air
								bubbles in the optical gel that surrounds the photomultiplier tubes of IceCube detectors. This work culminated in a talk at the
								Conference for Undergraduate Research and a poster presentation at the UWRF URSCA Fall Gala.

								<b>Teaching</b><br>I have been the instructor of record for PHYS 221: Introductory Physics Laboratory I for five semesters and for PHYS 133: 
								Introduction to Astronomy for two semesters.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Outreach</b><br>Starting in 2025, I am a Technical Associate at the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Observatory where I put on Public Nights and 
								Children's Programs for audiences of 28 people. Here, I operate 4" refractor and 24" reflector telescopes, as well as a planetarium. I also
								participate in outreach through the Physics and Astronomy Graduate Student Society. From 2022 to 2025, I was an Educational Associate
								at Mt. Cuba.

								<b>Equity & Inclusion</b><br>I am one of the founding members of the University of Delaware's Gender Minorities in Physics group.
